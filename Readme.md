# Train of Thought

## For Navigation
- I created 2 Navigators, kept the Tab navigator as the main navigator and passed the Stack Navigator as the component inside tab navigator.

## In HomeScreen
I checked if data exists in the local storage, if no, fetch the data and save it in local storage.

## In List Page
- I checked if data in persistent storage exist. If yes, store value in state variable. If no, redirect to HomePage.
- Display the list on Screen, make each Item Pressable and pass uid as a prop


- Write now Im trying to find particular product from List in Detail Page.
